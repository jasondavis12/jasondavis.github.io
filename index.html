<p>welcome to my webpage</p>
<p>For my website I kept it simple, I have a heading that says "My Car".I changed the color of the header to blue aswell. I could not find the banner to download, so I used an image I already had on my computer.I also added a banner, which is a picture of my car. there is a button on the bottom of the screen, which leads to another webpage";

<img src="IMG_4523.PNG" alt="car">
<button class="New Webpage" type="button"> Other Site</button>
