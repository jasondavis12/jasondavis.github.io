<h1>My Car</h1>
<p>welcome to my webpage</p>
<p>For my website I kept it simple, I have a heading that says "My Car". I could not find the banner to download, so I used an image I already had on my computer.I also added a banner, which is a picture of my car. I also made another website, that you go to by clicking the link.  ";
